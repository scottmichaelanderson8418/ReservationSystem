Purpose:
This project aims to create a plane reservation system that efficiently manages passenger information and reservations.

Functionality:

Passenger Management:

Stores passenger details (name, phone, seat, cost).
Provides methods to add, remove, and update passenger information.

Represents reservations as a doubly linked list of passengers.
Offers operations to add passengers to the beginning, end, or specific positions.
Allows for the removal of passengers from reservations.
Calculates and displays total passenger count and reservation cost.
User Interface:

Presents a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system.
Enables users to add, insert, remove, and view passenger information.
Validates user input to ensure data integrity.
Key Features:

Doubly Linked List: Efficient data structure for managing reservations.
Dummy Nodes: Simplifies list operations by providing head and tail placeholders.
Menu-Driven Interface: User-friendly interaction with the system.
Error Handling: Provides appropriate messages for invalid inputs or operations.
Data Validation: Ensures data consistency and accuracy.
Overall, this plane reservation system provides a robust and efficient solution for managing passenger information and reservations.
